## Network Information Flow Integrity: An Analysis on Subresource Integrity

### Abstract
Subresource Integrity is a security feature developed by W3C in 2016 that allows web developers 
to ensure that the resources retrieved from the Content Delivery Network (CDN) are not modified 
in transit. By protecting the integrity of the loaded content, SRI effectively protects the 
system from different attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), malicious code injections, or 
man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks. Along with the framework overview, this paper also analyzes 
any limitations the current SRI scheme has and proposes some enhancement features to tackle 
these challenges.
